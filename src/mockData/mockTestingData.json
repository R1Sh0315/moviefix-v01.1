    "title":"ICT — Fair Value Gap (FVG)",
    "discription":"Before getting to the heart of the matter, it is important to understand that ICT’s philosophy is based on two fundamental concepts: Market liquidity and Market inefficiency. In other words, what moves the price is the fact that it is constantly seeking liquidity (Buy-side/Sell-side liquidity), or resolving market inefficiencies or imbalances. Market imbalance is a situation resulting from an excess of buy or sell orders , making it impossible to match the orders of buyers and sellers. One such phenomenon that reveals this Market imbalance is the fair value gap (FVG). The ICT FVG is a particular price pattern observed within a three-candle sequence on a price chart. It is characterized by a large central candle surrounded by neighboring candles with upper and lower wicks that do not fully overlap the range of the large candle. This configuration signals a swift price surge or decline that transpires so rapidly that buyers or sellers cannot effectively counteract it, resulting in a market imbalance. ICT FVG usually happens within the ‘Displacement’. In fact, after the price reaches a liquidity level (old high/low, run on liquidity pools or turtle soup) and then reverses, a very powerful move in price action resulting in strong selling or buying pressure will occur. This aggressive move in price is called ‘Displacement’. Generally speaking, displacement will appear as a single or a group of candles that are all positioned in the same direction. These candles typically have large real bodies and very short wicks, suggesting very little disagreement between buyers and sellers."
